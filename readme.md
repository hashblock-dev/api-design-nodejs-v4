# API Design with Node.js v4

This project is based on the **API Design with Node.js v4** tutorial available on [Front-End Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).

## Description

This project uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to create a simple API. It includes a basic server that responds with a JSON message at the root (`/`).

## Project Structure

- `src/index.js`: Main entry point of the application.
- `src/server.js`: Express server configuration.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies with:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Starting the Server

To start the server, run:

```bash
node src/index.js
```

The server will be accessible by default at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
